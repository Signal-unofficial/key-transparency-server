key-transparency-server
========================

In an end-to-end encrypted messaging ecosystem, users must have some way to obtain the public keys of the users they wish to message.
This typically happens by users uploading a mapping of their public identifier (for example, their phone number)
to their public key to a central directory or service, and other users querying this service.
However, this requires users to trust that the service operator will behave honestly and not tamper with the keys.

_Key transparency_ is a mechanism to ensure that a service operator cannot do this without being detected.
It does so by sequentially recording updates to the mappings, where an update is either an insert of a new mapping
from a search key to a value, or an update of an existing mapping.
In this context, "search key" refers to something like "n:+18005550101", and the value it maps to could be the public key associated with that phone number.

Every update—also referred to as a log entry—is appended to the _key transparency log_,
a globally consistent, cryptographically-protected, append-only log.
Although the key transparency log is an append-only construct, callers will need to update existing search keys
from time to time (e.g. if they lose their phone and wind up generating a new public key).
The log allows for updates by appending new log entries that supersede previous entries for the same search key.

This repo defines a key transparency server that maintains such a log for Signal, as well as associated testing and development tools.
It uses this [protocol][ietf-protocol] in the IETF's datatracker, although it
accommodates Signal's specific application requirements and therefore contains some modifications.

Repo Overview
-------------

Key transparency code:

- `tree`: Defines the data structures used in the key transparency log,
  along with the logic to interact with them and generate proofs for various operations.

Operating the log:

- `cmd/kt-server`: Defines the server logic for interacting with the key transparency log.
- `db`: Defines various database and cache implementations.
- `filter-key-updates`: Defines the lambda that reads account changes from a DynamoDB stream and writes relevant updates to a Kinesis stream.

Tools/testing:

- `cmd/kt-client`: A tool for running various operations against a local or remote key transparency server.
- `cmd/kt-stress`: A tool for stress testing a key transparency server.
- `cmd/generate-auditing-test-vectors`: Generates test vectors for an auditor implementation.
- `cmd/generate-keys`: Generates a new set of private keys needed to run the key transparency server.

Key Transparency Services
-------------------------

The responsibilities of the key transparency server are split into three services:

- `KeyTransparencyQueryService` is a read-only server.
  It contains the `Search` and `Monitor` endpoints that clients use
  to query the log.
- `KeyTransparencyService` is a read-and-write server.
  It contains the audit endpoints and internally also writes updates to the log.
- `KeyTransparencyTestService` is a write-only server.
  It contains the `Update` endpoint and only exists for local testing
  and development use by `kt-client` and `kt-stress`.

All three services communicate via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/).
Their definitions can be found in the `cmd/kt-server/pb` directory.

Data Structures
---------------

The key transparency log consists of two main types of data structures:
a _log tree_ and _prefix trees_.

Log entries are stored as leaves in the log tree, and prefix trees are used to facilitate
efficient lookups of a specific mapping in the large and ever-growing log tree.
The transparency log uses various cryptographic techniques to append to the log tree and update prefix trees in a verifiable manner.

More details about each data structure and how they're used can be found in the [protocol][ietf-protocol].

Tests
-----

To run all tests:

```shell
docker compose run --rm tests
```

Quickstart
----------

You can run a key transparency server locally using `DynamoDB`.
To do so, first generate a new set of private keys:

```shell
docker compose run --rm generate-keys
```

Copy and paste the keys into `example/config.yaml`. Then run the read-only,
audit, and test servers locally (all three are required for `kt-client`
to have full functionality):

```shell
docker compose up -d server
```

To shut down the servers:

```shell
docker compose down server
```

You can now access metrics and the transparency servers
at the configured addresses by running `kt-client`:

```shell
docker compose run --rm -it client
```

You can interact with the transparency log via this client shell:

```shell
# Terminate the client
exit
```

```shell
# Add an ACI to the log
kt-client update aci <UUID> <base64_encoded_aci_identity_key>

# Add an E164 to the log. Be sure to use the same ACI as a previous update.
kt-client update aci <e164_formatted_number> <UUID>

# Search for the ACI and provide the value it's mapped to
kt-client search <UUID> <base64_encoded_aci_identity_key>

# Look up the distinguished key
kt-client distinguished
```

To look up a username hash, you must also provide the ACI and ACI identity key:

```shell
# Search for an E164
kt-client \
  -username_hash <base64url_encoded_username_hash> \
  search <UUID> <base64_encoded_aci_identity_key>
```

To look up an E164, you must provide the ACI, the ACI identity key, and an unidentified access key.
If using the `mock` AccountDB configuration, the default `-uak` value matches the one used by the mock implementation and can be left out.

```shell
# Search for an E164
kt-client \
  -e164 <e164_formatted_number> -uak <base64_encoded_uak> \
  search <UUID> <base64_encoded_aci_identity_key>
```

To time the latency of a search or monitor request:

```shell
kt-client -sample-size 50 -num-samples 10 \
  search-timing <UUID> <base64_encoded_aci_identity_key>

# Note that this will make a search request first so that it can compute the commitment index
# necessary for a monitor request
kt-client -sample-size 50 -num-samples 10 \
  monitor-timing <UUID> <base64_encoded_aci_identity_key>
```
